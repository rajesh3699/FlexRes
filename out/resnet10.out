ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

tensorflow 2.11.0 requires absl-py>=1.0.0, but you'll have absl-py 0.13.0 which is incompatible.

Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /state/partition1/job-32312100/matplotlib-946kevit because the default path (/home/ugo1/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
